GREGOR KICZALES: In this video, I'm just going

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:10,080
to go through some of the basic terminology and rules in Sudoku.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,330
So this is really kind of like a domain analysis for the problem

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,940
we're about to solve.

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:19,960
So first, Sudoku is played on a nine by nine board.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,710
Because it's nine by nine, the board has 81 of what we're going to call,

7
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,060
squares.

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,560
In addition to the 81 squares, we say that the board has nine rows,

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,380
because it's a nine by nine board, nine columns,

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:38,140
because it's a nine by nine board, and it also has nine boxes.

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,526
Where the boxes are, are little three by three blocks of the whole board.

12
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:46,970
And so there's three boxes at the top, three boxes kind of in the middle,

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,610
and three boxes at the bottom.

14
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:57,460
So the rows, the columns, and the boxes together comprise what are called,

15
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,050
units.

16
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:05,209
There's 27 total units, because there's nine rows, nine columns, and nine

17
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,880
boxes.

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,450
And adding nine, nine, and nine gets 27.

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:14,840
So there's 27 total units, and now we have enough terminology

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,560
to concisely say the goal of the game.

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,840
The goal of the game is to fill every square with a natural number from one

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:29,720
to nine but making sure that there's not a duplicate number in any unit.

23
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,452
So there can't be a single row that has a duplicate number in it.

24
00:01:32,452 --> 00:01:35,160
There can't be a single column that has a duplicate number in it.

25
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,420
And there can't be a single box that has a duplicate number it.

26
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,190
Because we have the term unit, we can say that more concisely

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,930
as there can't be a single unit that has a duplicate number in it.

28
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,240
So just to be clear, this is an illegal move.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,130
You can't put a six in that third box in the first row,

30
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,480
because there's already a six in that row.

31
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,290
So that's an illegal move.

32
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,450
Here's another illegal move.

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,509
You can't put a one there, because there's already a one in that column.

34
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,430
So that's an illegal move.

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,770
And here's another illegal move.

36
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,320
You can't put a three there.

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:21,070
You can't put the red three in, because there's already a three in that box.

38
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:24,430
That's an illegal move.

39
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:29,770
Again, the goal of the game is to fill in every square

40
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:34,920
with a natural from one to nine inclusive but making sure that there's

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,780
not a duplicate number in any unit.

42
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,750
So that's the quick terminology of Sudoku and quick summary of the rules.

43
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,650
Again, if you've never seen Sudoku before,

44
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,110
and you'd like a bit more detailed introduction to the rules of the game,

45
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,150
just do a web search and find one of the many Sudoku sites.

46
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,760
And you could play one or two quick games before picking up the next video.

47
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,602
